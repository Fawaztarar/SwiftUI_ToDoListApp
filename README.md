## Tarar To Do List
This iOS App allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Built with Swift, the app features user authentication, and data storage capabilities, thanks to Firebase Authentication and Firestore. Users can create, edit, and delete their to-dos, as well as mark tasks as complete.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out.
- Manage To-Dos: Users can add new to-do items, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed.
- Mark To-Dos as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete to keep track of their progress.
Technologies Used

## Swift: Main programming language.
- Firebase Authentication: For handling user authentication.
- Firestore: Used as a database to store user and to-do data.



## Architecture

This app is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to facilitate efficient management of UI logic, data, and user interactions through a clear separation into Models, Views, and ViewModels.

## Learning Outcomes

- Swift Fundamentals: Learned about the basics of Swift language including syntax, control flow, and data structures.
- iOS UI Components: Gained hands-on experience with UIKit to design the user interface.
- Firebase Integration: Learned how to integrate Firebase into an iOS app for authentication and real-time data storage.
- App Lifecycle Management: Understood the iOS app lifecycle for handling user interactions and app state transitions.

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced features such as task prioritization.
- Add push notifications to remind users of their tasks.
