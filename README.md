- iOS UI Components: Gained hands-on experience with UIKit to design the user interface.
- Firebase Integration: Learned how to integrate Firebase into an iOS app for authentication and real-time data storage.
- App Lifecycle Management: Understood the iOS app lifecycle for handling user interactions and app state transitions.

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced features such as task prioritization.
- Add push notifications to remind users of their tasks.
